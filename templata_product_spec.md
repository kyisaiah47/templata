# Templata Product Specification

> Skip the blank page. Start with abundant guidance for life's biggest moments.

## Executive Summary

Templata is a guidance-first platform that provides abundant expert insights, reflection prompts, and resources for life's most important decisions. Rather than gamified task completion, we focus on helping users think through complex decisions with professional guidance and thoughtful reflection.

**New Architecture (2025):** Email-style dual sidebar navigation with insertable prompts, 48+ reflection prompts per template, and comprehensive expert resources.

## Vision & Philosophy

### Core Philosophy: The Abundance Mindset
**Life's biggest moments deserve abundant guidance, not task lists.**

When planning a wedding, buying a home, starting a business, or making major decisions, people need **tons of reflection prompts, expert insights, and thoughtful guidance** - not checkboxes to complete. We believe in guidance over gamification.

### Our Approach
- **Abundant Content:** 48+ reflection prompts per template with detailed professional guidance
- **Codex Engine Insights:** AI-generated guidance specialized for life decision-making  
- **Comprehensive Resources:** Professional guides, checklists, and insider knowledge
- **Reflection Over Tasks:** Focus on helping users think through complex decisions
- **Insertable Prompts:** Browse and add relevant prompts to any section dynamically

### The Problem We Solve

#### The Gap in the Market:
