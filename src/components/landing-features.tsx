                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Remember the last time you faced a blank page for something important? That paralysis of "where do I even start?" We spent months refining our Axiom Engine to ensure you'll never feel that way again.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Each guide contains 50+ systematically organized questions covering 90%+ of what you need to consider. Not generic prompts generated on the fly—these are pre-loaded, expert-crafted questions that get to the heart of your decisions. Your answers auto-save as you think, so you can return anytime to continue exactly where you left off. The blank page is dead.

                  Imagine having a life coach sitting next to you, offering expert insights exactly when you need them. That's what our split-screen experience delivers—questions on the left, your answers in the middle, and curated expert readings on the right.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                  No more bouncing between 50 browser tabs trying to piece together advice from random blogs. Every reading is vetted, relevant, and appears right when you're thinking through that specific aspect of your plan. It's the difference between drowning in information and having clarity when it matters most.

                  Planning a wedding while also thinking about a career change? Your wedding thoughts shouldn't mix with your career reflections. Each guide lives in its own space—complete with dedicated questions, readings, calendar events, and tasks.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Think of it like having a separate notebook for each major life event, but infinitely more organized. Three panels show you everything at once: what to consider, what you've thought about, and what experts recommend. Plus blank notes when you need to free-form your thoughts. It's Notion's organizational power meets the focused guidance of a life coach.

                  Two months until your wedding. Three months until you close on that house. Six weeks until your career transition interview. When you're juggling multiple life events, time becomes precious.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Our calendar shows all your milestones and deadlines in one view, but lets you filter to focus on just one guide when you need clarity. Wedding venue tours don't clutter your home-buying timeline. It's how your brain actually works—capable of seeing the big picture or zooming into a single moment, depending on what you need right now.

                  That growing sense of "I should be doing something but I don't know what" is exhausting. Our task system transforms that anxiety into clarity—see everything that needs doing, organized by guide and priority.

                  Choose kanban view when you want to visualize your workflow, or list view when you just need to knock things out. Filter by your wedding guide during wedding planning season, then switch to your career guide when you're job hunting. Add your own custom tasks alongside the pre-loaded ones we suggest. Progress feels good when you can actually see it happening.
