        question: "What's included in the wedding planning template?",
        answer: "Everything you need: budget tracker with 50+ expense categories, guest list manager with RSVP tracking, vendor contact database, wedding timeline builder, seating chart planner, photography shot lists, music playlist organizer, and 12+ guided planning checklists written by professional wedding planners."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does it take to set up the wedding planner?",
        answer: "Just 3-5 minutes! Our guided setup wizard asks 8 key questions about your wedding date, budget, guest count, and venue preferences. The template automatically customizes all sections with your information, so you can start planning immediately."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I track my wedding budget with this template?",
        answer: "Yes! The budget tracker includes 50+ pre-loaded expense categories (venue, catering, photography, flowers, etc.), payment schedule tracking, vendor deposit monitoring, and automatic calculations. You'll see exactly where every dollar goes and get alerts when approaching budget limits."
      },
      {
        question: "Does the template help with guest list management?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Manage unlimited guests with RSVP tracking, meal preferences, plus-one management, address collection for invitations, and an integrated seating chart planner. Export guest lists for vendors and track responses in real-time."
      },
      {
        question: "How does the vendor coordination feature work?",
        answer: "Store all vendor contacts, contracts, and communications in one place. Track payment schedules, contract deadlines, and vendor availability. Includes templates for 15+ vendor types with essential questions to ask each one."
      },
      {
        question: "Is this better than using spreadsheets for wedding planning?",
        answer: "Much better! Unlike scattered spreadsheets, everything connects - your guest count affects catering costs, vendor schedules sync with your timeline, and budget changes update automatically. Plus you get professional guidance and checklists spreadsheets don't provide."
      },
      {
        question: "Can my fiancé and family help with planning using this template?",
        answer: "Yes! Share your planning workspace with your partner, parents, or wedding party. Set permissions for who can edit vs view different sections. Everyone stays updated on progress and can contribute to planning."
      },
      {
        question: "What if I'm planning a small/large wedding?",
        answer: "The template scales perfectly. Whether you're planning an intimate 20-person ceremony or a 300-guest celebration, all tools adapt to your guest count and budget. Small weddings can skip sections like extensive seating charts, while large weddings get detailed coordination tools."
      },
      {
        question: "How far in advance should I start using this wedding planner?",
        answer: "Ideally 12-18 months before your wedding date, but it's helpful at any stage. The template includes timeline recommendations for booking vendors 6-12 months out, sending invitations 8 weeks before, and final confirmations 1 week prior."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I print or export my wedding plans?",
        answer: "Yes! Generate beautiful PDFs for vendors, printable timelines for your wedding day, guest lists for venues, and emergency contact sheets. Export individual sections or your complete wedding plan in multiple formats."
